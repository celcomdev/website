A USSD service platform is the backend infrastructure that allows businesses to build, manage, and deliver USSD-based services such as checking account balances, buying airtime, or registering for services without the need for internet access."

These applications run on a telecom provider’s USSD gateway and often integrate with APIs or core systems."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "USSD is real-time and session-based, ideal for interactive menus and two-way services like mobile banking. SMS is a store-and-forward technology used for alerts and notifications. USSD is generally faster, doesn’t require internet, and is often free or low-cost for users, whereas SMS may incur a per-message cost and is less interactive."

For businesses, the cost of setting up a USSD code ranges between Ksh 50,000 to Ksh 200,000+ depending on whether it’s shared or dedicated.
