                                A bulk SMS gateway is the means through which a computer can send or receive bulk SMS
                                messages. Often allowing for the conversion and sending of other forms of media or
                                message, SMS gateways will generally utilize the same mobile phone networks as the
                                messages sent from mobile phones.

                                what you need to do:</p>

                                file to form a contact group within Celcom Africa bulk SMS platform. Here is what you
                                need to do:</p>
                            <p>Step 1: Log in to your account confirm you have enough SMS/credits if not purchase using
                                our Pay bill which will automatically credit your account.</p>

                            <p>Step 2: If you have not uploaded contacts import your address book into your SMS account.
                                Create groups to categorize your contacts accordingly and then upload your existing
                                contact list in excel “save as excel 97-2003 template".</p>

                            <p>Step 3: Select your desired SMS message recipients. If the message is intended for a
                                specific group, just select the group name. You can also paste a list of the numbers you
                                want to send to.</p>

                            <p>Step 4: Type in your SMS message and be sure to keep checking to avoid exceeding your
                                preferred SMS limit. Personalize SMS for recipients by inserting custom information
                                fields easily, from your contact list. You can also include a link to measure your
                                Return on Investment.</p>

                            <p>Step 5: Send or schedule the text message.</p>

                            <p>A Sender ID is a name or number that identifies the sender of an SMS message. The normal
                                Sender ID of an SMS message sent via the Bulk SMS gateway is a computer-generated long
                                number. But over an API,
                                this alpha-numeric variable can be set to any 11 characters in the range a-z, A-Z plus
                                0-9. It shows the SMS recipient who the SMS message is from, i.e. who is sending the
                                text message. In personal SMS messages,
                                the Sender ID would be the name of the sender as you have saved it in your mobile phone
                                contact list.
                                <br><br>This automated reference number can be replaced by text, for example, a
                                company's name. The setting of the Sender ID can only be enabled after you have
                                purchased bulk SMS credits.
                                <br><br>Sender ID requests are processed manually and we suggest you request a Sender ID
                                change within office hours for a swift response.
