		<h2>What is IVR?</h2>
		<p>Interactive Voice Response (IVR is a telephony menu system that permits the dial pad for identification, segmentation and routing of callers to the foremost appropriate agent within your team. It is an easy and effective and can significantly reduce costs and increase efficiency within any company.</p>
		<h2>Uses of interactive voice response</h2>
		<p>There are many uses for IVR systems. The most common use is to automate inbound and outbound calls and to route calls.</p>
		<p>The IVR system within the latter case eliminates the necessity for a telephone operator to answer incoming calls. This instance often presents a caller with a menu of options and may plan to answer commonly asked questions.</p>
		<p>A good example of this is often when a customer calls a movie place to inquire about the movie time. The IVRS uses an updated database to present the caller with an inventory of the newest available movie times, helping to eliminate call wait times and resulting in greater customer satisfaction.</p>
		<p>Here are a couple of other samples of ways an IVR system are often utilized in this manner:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>bank and stock account balances and transfers;</li>
			<li>office call routing;</li>
			<li>call center forwarding;</li>
			<li>simple order entry transactions; and</li>
			<li>selective information lookup.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>IVR systems also can be utilized in more complicated ways to simplify processes in other departments.</p>
		<p>Sales. IVR systems enable customers to fill out sales order forms with a phone keypad. The computer then sends the completed form to a salesperson.</p>
		<p>Marketing. Marketers can use IVR systems to send out surveys to gauge interest in a product or service.</p>
		<p>Medical records. Doctors can use an IVR system to transcribe notes and patient records and have a copy of the transcribed records sent to the office.</p>
